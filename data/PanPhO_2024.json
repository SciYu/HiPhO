For instance, we can employ the conservation of angular momentum to derive Kepler's laws. In the current scenario, we consider a normalized angular momentum, denoted as L, which is defined as: \n$L = \\hat{z} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\rho} \\times \\frac{d \\mathbf{\\rho}}{d s} = \\rho^{2} \\frac{d \\phi}{d s}$ \nHere, $\\mathbf{\\rho}$ represents the projected position vector on the two-dimensional $x-y$ plane, given by $\\mathbf{\\rho} = x \\hat{x} + y \\hat{y} = \\hat{x} \\rho \\cos \\phi + \\hat{y} \\rho \\sin \\phi$, with the projected cone center as the origin. $\\rho$ is the magnitude of vector $\\mathbf{\\rho}$ and $s$ is the arc length along the path of light on the surface.",
