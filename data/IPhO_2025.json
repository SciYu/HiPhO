Dimensions and notations for the model system \n\nThe system evolves in contact with the atmosphere, whose pressure fluctuates as in Fig. 4 (still with amplitude $A = 5 \\times 10^{2} \\mathrm{Pa}$ and period $\\tau_{1} = 1$ week). At the start $t = 0$, the mass $M$ is at rest at $x = 0$ and the tensions exerted by the two cables on either side of the mass $M$ are in balance while $P_{1}(0) = 0$. We define \n$\\xi = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{b}} + S_{\\mathrm{c}} - S_{\\mathrm{t}}}{S_{\\mathrm{b}} S_{\\mathrm{c}}} \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{s}}}{A} \\simeq \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{b}} + S_{\\mathrm{c}}}{S_{\\mathrm{b}} S_{\\mathrm{c}}} \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{s}}}{A}$ (Equation 3) \nwhere the last expression uses that $S_{\\mathrm{t}} \\ll S_{\\mathrm{b}}, S_{\\mathrm{c}}$ (which we will assume is valid until the end of the problem). \n\n(C.1) Determine the threshold $\\xi^{\\star}$ such that $M$ remains indefinitely at rest when $\\xi > \\xi^{\\star}$. \n\nFor the question (C.2) only, suppose that the mass $M$ is temporarily blocked at $x = X$. \n\n(C.2) Give an expression for the total tension force $\\vec{T} = T \\vec{u_{x}}$ acting on the mass $M$ due to the tension in two cables at this position, when $P_{1} = 0$, in terms of $\\rho, g, X$ and pertinent cross-sections. \n\nWhen $\\xi < \\xi^{\\star}$, starting again from $x = 0$ and $P_{1} = 0$, two different behaviours can be observed for $t \\geq  0$. To distinguish them, we need to introduce another parameter \n$\\lambda = \\frac{2 (S_{\\mathrm{b}} - S_{\\mathrm{t}}) }{S_{\\mathrm{b}}} \\frac{\\rho g X}{A} \\simeq \\frac{2 \\rho g X}{A}$ (Equation 4) \n\n(C.3) Complete the table in the answer sheet to indicate the condition under which each regime is obtained. Conditions must be expressed as inequalities on $\\xi$ and/or $\\lambda$. In addition, sketch the variations of $x(t) / X$ for $t \\in [0, 3 \\tau_{1}]$ that are consistent with the variations of $P_{1}(t) / A$ already present. Specification of remarkable points coordinates is not required. \n\nIn the real Cox's timepiece, energy provided by the mechanism is stored using a system of ratchets and used to raise a counterweight, like in a traditional clock. In the simplified model studied here, the energy recovered by the clock corresponds to the energy dissipated by the friction force exerted by the horizontal surface on the mass $M$. From now on, we assume that the system is dimensioned such that to work in the regime that allows the clock to recuperate energy. We also assume that the permanent regime is established. We denote $W$ the energy dissipated by the solid friction force during a period $\\tau_{1}$, which can be expressed only in terms of $F_{\\mathrm{s}}$ and $X$. \n\nAll else equal, $F_{\\mathrm{s}}$ and $X$ can be adjusted to maximize the energy $W$; we denote $F_{\\mathrm{s}}^{\\star}$ and $X^{\\star}$ their respective values in the optimal situation. \n\n(C.4) Considering $S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\simeq S_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{t}} \\ll S_{\\mathrm{b}}$, determine the expressions for $F_{\\mathrm{s}}^{\\star}$ and $X^{\\star}$ as functions of $\\rho, g, S_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $A$. Express the corresponding maximum energy $W^{\\star}$, then calculate its numerical value with $A = 5 \\times 10^{2} \\mathrm{Pa}$. \n\nWe denote $W_{\\mathrm{pr}}^{\\star}$ the work of atmospheric pressure forces received by the system in the optimal situation during a period $\\tau_{1}$.",
