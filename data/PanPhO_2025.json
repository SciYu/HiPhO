That is the golfer's nightmare! \n\nConsider the ball is a uniform solid sphere, i.e. $K = \\frac{2}{5}$. \n\nTo help explaining this phenomenon, one can investigate the motion of the ball in a reference frame $S^{\\prime}(x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime})$ that rotates about the $z$-axis with the same angular velocity $\\Omega \\hat{e}_{z}$ as the motion of the ball around the hole.
