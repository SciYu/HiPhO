As a result, total solar eclipses occur on average every 18 months. \n\nLet us consider a total solar eclipse where during the peak, the centre-points of Earth, the Moon and the Sun lie on a line on the same plane as the equator. We measure that right before the total solar eclipse ends at latitude $\\lambda = 28.5^{\\circ}$, the totality lasts for $t_0 = 2 \\mathrm{min}$. Earth's radius is $r_{e} = 6370 \\mathrm{km}$, Moon's radius is $r_{m} = 1740 \\mathrm{km}$, orbital period of the Moon $T_{m} = 27.3 \\mathrm{d}$,orbital radius of the Moon ${R}_{m} = 384000 \\mathrm{km}$. One day on Earth is $T_0 = 24 \\mathrm{hrs}$. \n\n(i) For how long is there a place on Earth where the total solar eclipse is observable? \n\n(ii) How many degrees in longitude on Earth does the total solar eclipse cover? \n\n(iii) What is the width of the path of totality near the equator? \n\n(iv) What is the longest amount of time the total eclipse is visible for a single location on Earth? \n\n(v) For how long is the total eclipse near the location described in (iii), at the distance of $a = 50 km$ from the centreline of the eclipse path? \n\nParts (i)–(v) are preliminary questions and should not be included in the final answer.",
