        "context": "[Precession of the Earth's axis] \n\n[Introduction] \n\nIt has been known since ancient times that the Earth's axis of rotation precesses. That is, the axis itself rotates around the line perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, i.e., the plane containing the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus concluded that the annual angular displacement of the axis was approximately 45'' (seconds of arc), which would imply that the period of axial precession is around 29000 years. Modern measurements indicate that the period is approximately 25800 years. In this problem, you are asked to investigate this phenomenon using Newtonian mechanics. \n\nYou may need the following constants: \ngravitational constant: $G = 6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{Nm}^{2} / \\mathrm{kg}^{2}$ \naverage radius of Earth: $R = 6.371 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{m}$ \nmass of the Earth: $M_{E} = 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\mathrm{kg}$ \naverage distance of the Sun from the Earth: $d_{SE} = 1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{m}$ \nmass of the Sun: $M_{S} = 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\mathrm{kg}$ \naverage distance of the Moon from the Earth: $d_{ME} = 3.844 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{m}$ \nmass of the Moon: $M_{M} = 7.348 \\times 10^{22} \\mathrm{kg}$ \nEarth's axial tilt: $\\alpha = 23.5^{\\circ}$ \n\n[Part A: The shape of the Earth] \n\nThe Sun and the Moon exert nonzero torques on the Earth because of its non-spherical shape, giving rise to its axial precession. The main reason behind the Earth's non-spherical shape is the centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation about its axis. The tectonic plates located on the Earth's surface have deformed over millions of years to minimize stress within them. Therefore, as an approximation, let us model the Earth as a large liquid droplet of uniform density whose shape is determined by centrifugal and gravitational forces. In this model, the Earth's surface is an oblate spheroid (ellipsoid of revolution) characterized by the polar radius $R_{p}$ and the equatorial radius $R_{e}$ (see Figure A.1). \n\n[figure1] \nFigure A.1. The ellipsoidal shape of the Earth. The polar and equatorial radii are indicated. $\\alpha = 23.5^{\\circ}$ is the angle between the Earth's axis of rotation and the normal of the ecliptic plane. \n\nThe difference between the equatorial and polar radii of the Earth, $h_{\\max} = R_{e} - R_{p}$ is much smaller than the average radius $R = (R_{e} + R_{p}) / 2$. Up to a dimensionless factor, the value of $h_{\\max}$ can be expressed in terms of the angular speed of the Earth's rotation $\\omega$, its mass $M_{E}$ and average radius $R$ as \n$h_{\\max} \\propto G^{-1} \\omega^{\\beta} M_E^{\\gamma} R^{\\delta}$ \nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $\\beta, \\gamma$ and $\\delta$ are constant exponents. \n\n(A.1) Find the values of exponents: $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, and $\\delta$. \n\n(A.2) Calculate the numerical value of $h_{\\text{max}}$ in $km$ assuming that the dimensionless factor in the relation given above equals 1. \n\nRegardless of whether you were able to find $h_{\\text{max}}$ in part A.2., use the empirical value $h_{\\text{max}} = 21 \\mathrm{km}$ in the following questions. \n\n[Part B: The time-averaged gravitational field of the Sun] \n\nTo see why the Sun exerts a nonzero torque (with respect to the center of the Earth) on our planet, consider Figure B.1 below. The difference in distance from the Sun causes the gravitational force $F_{1}$ to be greater than its counterpart $F_{2}$. \n\n[figure2] \nFigure B.1. Explanation of the nonzero torques exerted by the Sun (right side of the figure) on the Earth (left side). \n\nThe magnitude of this torque acting on the Earth varies continuously during the year. In the position shown in Figure B.1, the torque is maximal, a quarter of a year later, due to symmetry, the torque becomes zero. After half a year, it reaches the maximum again, three-quarters of a year later it is zero once again, and so on. Since the period of axial precession is much larger than one year, this time-dependent torque can be approximated well by its one-year average. \n\nTo calculate the average torque exerted by the Sun on the Earth, let us determine first the time average of the gravitational field generated by the Sun in the vicinity of the Earth. This average can be calculated as the field of a uniformly dense mass ring, a Sun ring, whose mass equals the mass of the Sun $M_{S}$ and whose radius equals the average distance between the Sun and the Earth $d_{SE}$ (see Figure B.2). \n\n[figure3] \nFigure B.2. Time averaging is equivalent to uniformly spreading the Sun along the circle of radius $d_{SE}$. \n\nLet our cylindrical coordinate system have the origin at the center of the Earth, and let the $z$ axis be perpendicular to the ecliptic plane (i.e. the plane of the ring). The axis of rotation of the Earth makes an angle of $\\alpha = 23.5^{\\circ}$ with the $z$ axis. \n\n(B.1) Find the direction and magnitude of the gravitational field generated by the Sun ring at a point on the $z$ axis. Write your answer in terms of $M_{S}, d_{SE}$, and the coordinate $z$. Assume that $|z| \\ll d_{SE}$. \n\n(B.2) Find the direction and magnitude of the gravitational field generated by the Sun ring at a point in the ecliptic plane whose distance from the origin is $r$. Assume $r \\ll d_{SE}$. \n\n[Part C: The torque acting on the Earth] \n\nIn this section, you are asked to determine the torque exerted on the Earth due to the gravitational field obtained in Part B. For simplicity, consider the Earth as a rigid body with homogeneous mass distribution. Let us take into account that the rotational ellipsoid can be imagined as if we removed excess parts from a sphere with the equatorial radius of Earth $R_{e}$ (see Figure C.1). \n\n[figure4] \nFigure C.1.

After half a year, it reaches the maximum again, three-quarters of a year later it is zero once again, and so on. Since the period of axial precession is much larger than one year, this time-dependent torque can be approximated well by its one-year average. \n\nTo calculate the average torque exerted by the Sun on the Earth, let us determine first the time average of the gravitational field generated by the Sun in the vicinity of the Earth.

That is, the axis itself rotates around the line perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, i.e., the plane containing the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus concluded that the annual angular displacement of the axis was approximately 45'' (seconds of arc), which would imply that the period of axial precession is around 29000 years. Modern measurements indicate that the period is approximately 25800 years. In this problem, you are asked to investigate this phenomenon using Newtonian mechanics. \n\nYou may need the following constants: \ngravitational constant: $G = 6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{Nm}^{2} / \\mathrm{kg}^{2}$ \naverage radius of Earth: $R = 6.371 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{m}$ \nmass of the Earth: $M_{E} = 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\mathrm{kg}$ \naverage distance of the Sun from the Earth: $d_{SE} = 1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{m}$ \nmass of the Sun: $M_{S} = 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\mathrm{kg}$ \naverage distance of the Moon from the Earth: $d_{ME} = 3.844 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{m}$ \nmass of the Moon: $M_{M} = 7.348 \\times 10^{22} \\mathrm{kg}$ \nEarth's axial tilt: $\\alpha = 23.5^{\\circ}$ \n\n[Part A: The shape of the Earth] \n\nThe Sun and the Moon exert nonzero torques on the Earth because of its non-spherical shape, giving rise to its axial precession. The main reason behind the Earth's non-spherical shape is the centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation about its axis. The tectonic plates located on the Earth's surface have deformed over millions of years to minimize stress within them. Therefore, as an approximation, let us model the Earth as a large liquid droplet of uniform density whose shape is determined by centrifugal and gravitational forces. In this model, the Earth's surface is an oblate spheroid (ellipsoid of revolution) characterized by the polar radius $R_{p}$ and the equatorial radius $R_{e}$ (see Figure A.1). \n\n[figure1] \nFigure A.1. The ellipsoidal shape of the Earth. The polar and equatorial radii are indicated. $\\alpha = 23.5^{\\circ}$ is the angle between the Earth's axis of rotation and the normal of the ecliptic plane. \n\nThe difference between the equatorial and polar radii of the Earth, $h_{\\max} = R_{e} - R_{p}$ is much smaller than the average radius $R = (R_{e} + R_{p}) / 2$. Up to a dimensionless factor, the value of $h_{\\max}$ can be expressed in terms of the angular speed of the Earth's rotation $\\omega$, its mass $M_{E}$ and average radius $R$ as \n$h_{\\max} \\propto G^{-1} \\omega^{\\beta} M_E^{\\gamma} R^{\\delta}$ \nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $\\beta, \\gamma$ and $\\delta$ are constant exponents. \n\n(A.1) Find the values of exponents: $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, and $\\delta$. \n\n(A.2) Calculate the numerical value of $h_{\\text{max}}$ in $km$ assuming that the dimensionless factor in the relation given above equals 1. \n\nRegardless of whether you were able to find $h_{\\text{max}}$ in part A.2., use the empirical value $h_{\\text{max}} = 21 \\mathrm{km}$ in the following questions. \n\n[Part B: The time-averaged gravitational field of the Sun] \n\nTo see why the Sun exerts a nonzero torque (with respect to the center of the Earth) on our planet, consider Figure B.1 below. The difference in distance from the Sun causes the gravitational force $F_{1}$ to be greater than its counterpart $F_{2}$. \n\n[figure2] \nFigure B.1. Explanation of the nonzero torques exerted by the Sun (right side of the figure) on the Earth (left side). \n\nThe magnitude of this torque acting on the Earth varies continuously during the year. In the position shown in Figure B.1, the torque is maximal, a quarter of a year later, due to symmetry, the torque becomes zero. After half a year, it reaches the maximum again, three-quarters of a year later it is zero once again, and so on. Since the period of axial precession is much larger than one year, this time-dependent torque can be approximated well by its one-year average. \n\nTo calculate the average torque exerted by the Sun on the Earth, let us determine first the time average of the gravitational field generated by the Sun in the vicinity of the Earth. This average can be calculated as the field of a uniformly dense mass ring, a Sun ring, whose mass equals the mass of the Sun $M_{S}$ and whose radius equals the average distance between the Sun and the Earth $d_{SE}$ (see Figure B.2). \n\n[figure3] \nFigure B.2. Time averaging is equivalent to uniformly spreading the Sun along the circle of radius $d_{SE}$. \n\nLet our cylindrical coordinate system have the origin at the center of the Earth, and let the $z$ axis be perpendicular to the ecliptic plane (i.e. the plane of the ring). The axis of rotation of the Earth makes an angle of $\\alpha = 23.5^{\\circ}$ with the $z$ axis. \n\n(B.1) Find the direction and magnitude of the gravitational field generated by the Sun ring at a point on the $z$ axis. Write your answer in terms of $M_{S}, d_{SE}$, and the coordinate $z$. Assume that $|z| \\ll d_{SE}$. \n\n(B.2) Find the direction and magnitude of the gravitational field generated by the Sun ring at a point in the ecliptic plane whose distance from the origin is $r$. Assume $r \\ll d_{SE}$. \n\n[Part C: The torque acting on the Earth] \n\nIn this section, you are asked to determine the torque exerted on the Earth due to the gravitational field obtained in Part B. For simplicity, consider the Earth as a rigid body with homogeneous mass distribution. Let us take into account that the rotational ellipsoid can be imagined as if we removed excess parts from a sphere with the equatorial radius of Earth $R_{e}$ (see Figure C.1). \n\n[figure4] \nFigure C.1. The ellipsoidal shape of the Earth can be imagined as if the excess parts were removed from a complete sphere of radius $R_{e}$. \n\n(C.1) Find the mass $m$ of one of the two excess regions indicated in Figure C.1. Express your answer in terms of $h_{\\text{max}}$, the mass of the Earth $M_{E}$, and its polar radius $R_{p}$. \n\nIt can be shown that the torque acting on the excess regions is equivalent to the torque acting on two point masses, each with a mass equal to $2m / 5$, positioned at the endpoints $A$ and $B$ of the polar diameter (see Figure C.1). \n\n(C.2) Given this idea, find the torque $\\tau$ exerted by the Sun ring on the Earth. Express your answer in terms of $M_{E}, M_{S}, d_{SE}, R$ (the average radius), $h_{\\max}$ and the angle $\\alpha$. You can use that $h_{\\max} \\ll R$. \n\n[Part D: Angular speed of the precession of the Earth's axis] \n\nThe Earth's axis of rotation moves very slowly around the $z$ axis in a conical motion. That is, it precesses. \n\n(D.1) Give an expression for the period $T_{1}$ of precession of the Earth's axis. Express your answer in terms of $M_{S}, d_{SE}$, the angular speed $\\omega$ of the Earth's rotation, $h_{\\text{max}}, R$ and $\\alpha$. \n\n(D.2) Calculate the precession period $T_{1}$ in years. \n\n[Part E: The effect of the Moon] \n\nThe value obtained in Part D is much larger than the observed value. The reason for this is that so far we have only considered the torque exerted by the Sun, and neglected the effect of the Moon. In the following calculations, assume that the Moon's orbit is in the ecliptic plane, and that the orbit of the Moon around the Earth is a circle of radius $d_{ME}$. Let us denote the mass of the Moon by $M_{M}$ and the period of precession in this modified model by $T_{2}$. \n\n(E.1) By what factor $T_{2} / T_{1}$ does the period of precession of the Earth's axis change if we also take into account the torque exerted by the Moon? Give your answer in terms of $d_{ME}, d_{SE}, M_{S}$ and $M_{M}$.",

Find $J_{0}$ in terms of $\\gamma$, $d$ and fundamental constants. \n\n[Part B: Spin Waves] \n\nIn what follows we investigate the dynamics of spins. A spin is a particle with intrinsic angular momentum $\\vec{S}$, which has an associated magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ related to $\\vec{S}$ via the gyromagnetic ratio as in Part A.1, $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$. \n\nThe magnetic dipoles of two spins interact with each other. However, this interaction is negligible compared to another interaction arising from a quantum mechanical origin, which is not present in classical systems.

        "context": "[Waves and Phase Transitions in Spin Systems] \n\n[Introduction] \n\nIn classical physics, angular momentum arises from the motion of an object around an axis - whether it be a spinning top, a rotating planet, or an orbiting electron in the atom. However, in quantum physics, fundamental particles possess an intrinsic and quantized form of angular momentum called spin. This property plays a crucial role in various physical phenomena, ranging from materials properties, such as magnetism, to modern applications, such as quantum computing. \n\nIn this problem we will treat spin classically, which will lead to some qualitatively correct results. You will explore the physics of spin systems through spin-spin interactions, evolution under magnetic fields, and statistical physics to understand the emergence of spin waves and phase transitions in magnets. \n\nUseful information: \n$\\cosh(x) \\equiv \\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}, \\sinh(x) \\equiv \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}, $\\tanh(x) \\equiv \\frac{\\sinh(x)}{\\cosh(x)} \\approx x - \\frac{1}{3} x^3$ for $|x| \\ll 1$. \n\nThe magnetic field due to a magnetic dipole of moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ at a position $\\vec{r}$ away from it is given by ($\\mu_{0}$ is is the vacuum permeability): \n$\\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{3(\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{r})\\vec{r}}{r^5} - \\frac{\\vec{\\mu}}{r^3} \\right)$ \n\n[Part A. Precession and interactions of magnetic dipoles] \n\nConsider a ring of radius $R$, total mass $M$, and charge $Q > 0$ distributed uniformly. The ring rotates with an angular speed $\\omega$ around a perpendicular axis that passes through its center of mass. \n\n(A.1) It is possible to write the ring's magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ in terms of its angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ as $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{L}$. Find the constant $\\gamma$, called the gyromagnetic ratio, of this system in terms of $Q$ and $M$. \n\nThe ring is placed in a weak uniform magnetic field $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}$, making an angle $\\theta$ with $\\vec{\\omega}$, see Figure A.1. \n\n[figure1] \nFigure A.1. \n\n(A.2) Find the angular frequency $\\omega_{L}$ of the angular momentum precession (the so-called Larmor frequency) due to the external magnetic field in terms of $B$ and $\\gamma$. Take the positive direction to be counter-clockwise with respect to $+z$. \n\nNow we turn off the external magnetic field and place an identical ring at a horizontal distance $d \\gg R$ from the original ring such that the magnetic moment of the new ring $\\vec{\\mu}_{2}$ makes an angle $\\theta$ with $\\vec{\\mu}_{1}$, see Figure A.2. \n\n[figure2]\nFigure A.2. \n\n(A.3) The magnetic interaction energy between the two rings can be written as $U = J_{0} \\vec{L}_{1} \\cdot \\vec{L}_{2}$, where $J_{0}$ is a constant and $\\vec{L}_{i}$ is the angular momentum of the $i$-th ring. Find $J_{0}$ in terms of $\\gamma$, $d$ and fundamental constants. \n\n[Part B: Spin Waves] \n\nIn what follows we investigate the dynamics of spins. A spin is a particle with intrinsic angular momentum $\\vec{S}$, which has an associated magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ related to $\\vec{S}$ via the gyromagnetic ratio as in Part A.1, $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$. \n\nThe magnetic dipoles of two spins interact with each other. However, this interaction is negligible compared to another interaction arising from a quantum mechanical origin, which is not present in classical systems. Interestingly, the energy associated with this quantum interaction has the same form which we found in Part A.3, scaling with $\\vec{S}_{1} \\cdot \\vec{S}_{2}$, albeit with the opposite sign. \n\nNow we will look at a very long chain of spins. The positions of the spins are fixed along the $x$-axis, with a distance $a$ separating them, see Figure B.1. We will approximate the total energy of the system by considering the interactions between nearest neighbors only, so that the energy can be written as \n$E = -J \\sum_i \\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_{i+1}$ \nwhere $J > 0$ is the interaction strength, and $\\vec{S}_{i}$ is the spin angular momentum vector of the $i$-th dipole, with magnitude $S$. The spin vectors are free to rotate in three dimensions. Notice that the sign of the energy is different from the last part. This interaction is purely quantum mechanical. \n\n[figure3] \nFigure B.1. \n\n(B.1) The energy terms containing $\\vec{S}_{i}$ in the sum above can be viewed as the interaction energy between an effective magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{i, \\text{eff}}$ and the magnetic moment of $\\vec{S}_{i}$. Find $\\vec{B}_{i, \\text{eff}}$ and express your answer in terms of $J$, the gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$, and other spins $\\vec{S}_{j}$ (specify the indices $j$ in relation to $i$) \n\n(B.2) Using the concept of effective magnetic field, express the rate of change of the $i$-th spin vector, $d \\vec{S}_{i} / d t$, in terms of $J$, $\\vec{S}_{i}$, and other spins $\\vec{S}_{j}$ (specify the indices $j$ in relation to $i$). \n\nFor the rest of Part B, assume that the system is highly magnetized along the $z$ direction, so we can use the approximations $S_{i, z} \\approx S$ and $d S_{i, z} / d t \\approx 0$ for each spin, see Figure B.2. In this regime, the set of equations describing the spins time evolution is satisfied by a traveling wave solution for $S_{i, x}$ and $S_{i, y}$ characterized by a wave vector $k$ and angular frequency $\\omega$. \n\n[figure4]\nFigure B.2. \n\n(B.3) Find the relationship between $\\omega$ and $k$ (known as the dispersion relation, $\\omega(k)$) for the spin waves in terms of $J$, $S$ and $a$. Hint: express the position of the $i$-th spin as $x = a \\cdot i$. \n\nThe spin wave described above carries energy and momentum. At low energies, the relation between its energy and momentum resembles that of a massive classical particle with an effective mass $m_{\\text{eff}}$, a concept known as a quasi-particle. \n\n(B.4) For small $k$ ($k \\ll 1 / a$), find the effective mass $m_{\\text{eff}}$ of the spin wave. Express your answer in terms of $J, S, a$ and fundamental constants. \n\nSpin waves can be experimentally probed using inelastic neutron scattering. Although neutrons have zero net charge, they have a finite spin, allowing them to interact with other spins. \n\n[figure5] \nFigure B.3.",

Let the refractive index of the prism be $n$. Express the angle of deviation $\\delta$ of the light ray after passing through the prism in terms of $\\alpha, n$ and $\\varphi$. \n\nThe most common type of halo forms when tiny ice crystals take the shape of regular hexagonal prisms. Light from the Sun falls onto randomly oriented ice crystals drifting in the atmosphere and scatters into various directions.
