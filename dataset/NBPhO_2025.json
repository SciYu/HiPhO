It appears, however, that once a dynamical thermal equilibrium is reached, the equilibrium temperature of a wet surface depends only on the relative humidity and the temperature of air and does not depend on the convection speed (as long as the convection is not too weak). This is so because the two competing processes determining the equilibrium state both depend on the thickness of the laminar (non-turbulent) surface layer exactly in the same way. In what follows we shall use the following assumptions. (a) Atop a wet surface (such as a sweating bare skin), there is a layer with a laminar flow of a certain thickness $d$. (b) Atop the laminar layer, the surrounding turbulent flow keeps a constant temperature $T$ and relative humidity $r$, both equal to the respective values in the bulk of the surrounding air. (c) Heat flux from beneath the wet surface (e.g. through the skin) can be neglected. (d) The heat conductivity of air $\\kappa = 30 \\mathrm{mW} \\mathrm{m}^{-1} \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ at $T = 70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (neglect the temperature dependence), and the diffusivity of water molecules in air $D = 26 \\mathrm{mm}^{2} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Neglect the dependence of $D$ on the temperature. Note that the particle flux (net number of molecules passing a cross-section in y-z-plane per second and per cross-sectional area) can be found as $J = D \\frac{\\mathrm{d} n}{\\mathrm{d} x}$, where $n$ denotes the number density (number of molecules per volume). \n\nParts (i)–(ii) are preliminary questions and should not be included in the final answer.",

With what period does it start oscillating around the mid-plane? \n\nIn reality, density decreases with growing $|z|$. Measuring density has been a great challenge because of contributions from dark and other difficult-to-see matter. Here, we consider a breakthrough method of doing it. Consider the distributions of the stars in our neighbourhood on the $z$-$v_{z}$ phase plane, where each star is a dot with coordinates $(v_{z}, z)$; $v_{z}$ denotes the $z$-component the star's velocity, and $z$ - the vertical coordinate. Initially, these dots were distributed nearly homogeneously, but some time ago, the Milky Way was perturbed externally, probably by a passing-by dwarf galaxy; this shuffled the positions and velocities of stars, creating a bar-shaped overdensity region. When moving within that bar-shaped region from the centre to the periphery, the total energy per mass of stars increased monotonously. Over time, this overdensity region started \"winding up\", due to the oscillation periods of stars in the vertical plane depending on their oscillation amplitude $z_{\\mathrm{m}}$, and evolved into a spiral pictured below (Antoja et al. 2018, Nature 561, 360). An observation that you need to exploit below is that the ordering of stars by energies along the spiral today remains the same as it was at the time of perturbation. \n\nThe oscillation period of stars depends on the amplitude $z_{\\mathrm{m}}$ because the gravitational potential (the potential energy per mass) $\\Phi(z)$ is not parabolic. In such a case, the period can be approximately found by substituting the real $\\Phi(z)$ with a $k z^{2}$ matching $\\Phi(z)$ at $z = z_{\\mathrm{m}}$, i. e. with $k = \\Phi(z_{\\mathrm{m}}) / z_{\\mathrm{m}}^{2}$. \n\n[figure1] \n\n(iii) At the intersection points of the spiral with $v_z = 0$, calculate $\\Phi(z)$ by interpolating data linearly where appropriate; plot your results (this follows the analysis of Guo et al. 2024, ApJ, 960, 133) \n\nParts (i)–(iii) are preliminary questions and should not be included in the final answer.",

For our purposes, we can model the galactic gravity field as being created by a continuous mass density $\\rho$ (that accounts for the masses of stars, dark matter, gas, interstellar dust, etc), and assume that this mass forms an infinite mirror-symmetric plate, i.e. $\\rho \\equiv \\rho(z)$ and $\\rho(z) = \\rho(-z)$ is independent of $x$ and $y$. Throughout the problem, you may assume that each star's total energy is conserved over the entire considered time period. Gravitational constant $G = 6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{m}^{3} \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\mathrm{s}^{-2} = 4.30 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{pc} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}^{-1} (\\mathrm{km}/\\mathrm{s})^{2}$. \n\n(i) Assuming that the mass density is constant over the plate's thickness. i.e. $\\rho(z) = \\rho_{0}$, what is the acceleration $a_{z}$ of a star at a distance $z$ from the mid-plane? \n\n(ii) Consider a star that starts with zero velocity at a distance of $z = a$ from the mid-plane. With what period does it start oscillating around the mid-plane? \n\nIn reality, density decreases with growing $|z|$. Measuring density has been a great challenge because of contributions from dark and other difficult-to-see matter. Here, we consider a breakthrough method of doing it. Consider the distributions of the stars in our neighbourhood on the $z$-$v_{z}$ phase plane, where each star is a dot with coordinates $(v_{z}, z)$; $v_{z}$ denotes the $z$-component the star's velocity, and $z$ - the vertical coordinate. Initially, these dots were distributed nearly homogeneously, but some time ago, the Milky Way was perturbed externally, probably by a passing-by dwarf galaxy; this shuffled the positions and velocities of stars, creating a bar-shaped overdensity region. When moving within that bar-shaped region from the centre to the periphery, the total energy per mass of stars increased monotonously. Over time, this overdensity region started \"winding up\", due to the oscillation periods of stars in the vertical plane depending on their oscillation amplitude $z_{\\mathrm{m}}$, and evolved into a spiral pictured below (Antoja et al. 2018, Nature 561, 360). An observation that you need to exploit below is that the ordering of stars by energies along the spiral today remains the same as it was at the time of perturbation. \n\nThe oscillation period of stars depends on the amplitude $z_{\\mathrm{m}}$ because the gravitational potential (the potential energy per mass) $\\Phi(z)$ is not parabolic. In such a case, the period can be approximately found by substituting the real $\\Phi(z)$ with a $k z^{2}$ matching $\\Phi(z)$ at $z = z_{\\mathrm{m}}$, i. e. with $k = \\Phi(z_{\\mathrm{m}}) / z_{\\mathrm{m}}^{2}$. \n\n[figure1] \n\n(iii) At the intersection points of the spiral with $v_z = 0$, calculate $\\Phi(z)$ by interpolating data linearly where appropriate; plot your results (this follows the analysis of Guo et al. 2024, ApJ, 960, 133) \n\n(iv) Assuming that the mass density is almost constant for $|z| \\leq 0.3 \\mathrm{kpc}$, what is the mass density near $z = 0$? \n\nParts (i)–(iv) are preliminary questions and should not be included in the final answer.",
